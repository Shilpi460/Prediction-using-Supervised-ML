# TASK 1 : Prediction using Supervised ML<br>
This is my first task during my intership in Data Science & Business Analytics at The Sparks Foundation where the problem statement is to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours and to calculate the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day.<br>
In this task, I have used R with stats library for machine learning to implement the regression function and caret library to check the accuracy and the error of the trained model.<br>
This is a simple Linear regression task as it involves only 2 variables.<br>
